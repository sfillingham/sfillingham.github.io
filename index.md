## Research Interests
galaxy evolution, quenching, star formation, environmental effects,
large surveys, spectroscopy, galaxy formation, reionization

Generally my research interests focus on galaxy evolution. More
specifically I am interested how the environment surround a massive
galaxy modifies the properties of the satellite galaxies orbiting
within the hosts' dark matter halo.

To this end, I compare the properties of the observed satellites to
various models built on top of the cosmological simulations.
Additionally, I have been leading the design, data reduction, and
analysis of a z = 0.8 survey of low-mass galaxies suspected to be in
galaxy groups.
